## About Me 

I'm an experienced customer operations professional currently pursuing a Master’s in Business Analytics at UC San Diego. After several years working closely with customers and internal teams in high-growth startups, I saw firsthand how valuable data can be in improving processes, identifying opportunities, and supporting smarter decision-making. I returned to school to build a stronger foundation in analytics, focusing on the tools and techniques that turn customer and business data into meaningful and actionable insights. With a blend of practical experience and analytical training, I’m looking to contribute to data-driven teams in customer strategy, revenue operations, or sales analytics.
