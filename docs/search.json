I returned to school to build a stronger foundation in analytics, focusing on the tools and techniques that turn customer and business data into meaningful and actionable insights. With a blend of practical experience and analytical training, I’m looking to contribute to data-driven teams in customer strategy, revenue operations, or sales analytics."
